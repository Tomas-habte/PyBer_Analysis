# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the relationship between the type of area and the number of drivers, riders, and fares on a ridesharing app. This can help improve access to ridesharing services on the app and determine affordability for underserved neighbourhoods. 


## Results
Below are the differences that were found by conducting an analysis:

| Urban areas have the highest number of rides  | Urban areas have the largest number of drivers  |
| ------------- | ------------- |

The multi-line chart below illustrates the total fare by area type for the first few months of 2019 and shows that urban areas have the highest total fare.

# Summary 
Based on the results from the analysis shown above, we make the following recommendations to the CEO to address the disparities among the area types:

1. As shown in the multi-line chart, there are differences in total fare by area type depending on the month. Therefore, we recommend the CEO to use trends like rural areas having a peak at the start of April to optimize the pricing.
2. The number of rides is significantly low in rural areas while the average fare is the highest. To address this, the CEO should give fare discounts to encourage more people in rural areas to use the app and can eventually raise the prices again as more rural people get used to the ridesharing app. 
3. There are only 78 drivers in rural areas so we recommend that the CEO promotes the app more in rural areas to get more drivers to sign up. This can help reduce the wait times for riders in rural areas which can help increase ridership.
